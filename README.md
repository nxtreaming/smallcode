**AI coding agent optimized for small LLMs (≤20B parameters)**

SmallCode is a terminal-native coding agent designed from the ground up to extract useful work from local models (7B-20B) running on consumer hardware. While tools like OpenCode assume frontier models with 128k+ context and perfect tool calling, SmallCode compensates for the limitations of small models through intelligent architecture.

## Why SmallCode?

| | OpenCode | SmallCode |
|---|----------|-----------|
| **Target** | Frontier models (Claude, GPT-4) | 7B-20B local models |
| **Context** | Dumps everything | Budget-managed, summarized |
| **Tool calling** | Assumes reliable JSON | Forgiving multi-format parser |
| **Planning** | Single-shot | TODO-file decomposed steps |
| **Editing** | Full file write | Search-and-replace patch |
| **Privacy** | API calls to cloud | Fully local, no network needed |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g smallcode

# Or run directly with npx
npx smallcode

# Start in your project directory
cd my-project
smallcode
```

SmallCode includes [BoneScript](https://github.com/Doorman11991/BoneScript) and [budget-aware-mcp](https://github.com/Doorman11991/budget-aware-mcp) as dependencies — everything installs in one go.

### Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- A local LLM server (LM Studio, Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint)

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```bash
# Required
SMALLCODE_MODEL=your-model-name
SMALLCODE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:1234/v1

# Optional: escalation (auto-fallback to cloud on hard fail)
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
# DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...
```

See `.env.example` for all options. Also supports `smallcode.toml` for backwards compatibility.

## Architecture

SmallCode is built with a modular architecture:

```
bin/
├── smallcode.js        Main entry point + agent loop
├── governor.js         Tool scoring, verification, decompose
├── escalation.js       Cloud model fallback (Claude/OpenAI)
├── commands.js         TUI slash commands
├── tui.js              Classic TUI renderer
└── bonescript_guide.js BoneScript syntax reference

src/
├── tui/fullscreen.js   Fullscreen alternate-buffer TUI
├── plugins/loader.js   Plugin system
├── plugins/skills.js   Skill system
├── tools/builtin/      Tool implementations
├── governor/           Verifier, scorer, hard fail
└── core/               Config, events, session
```

## Key Features

### BoneScript Integration
For Node.js/TypeScript backends, SmallCode uses BoneScript — write ONE `.bone` file and compile it to a complete project (routes, auth, DB, events, migrations, SDK, admin panel, Docker, CI). Reduces 8-15 tool calls to 1-2, dramatically improving reliability with small models.

### Model Escalation
When the local model hard fails after retry + decompose, SmallCode can optionally escalate to a stronger cloud model (Claude, OpenAI, DeepSeek). Fully opt-in — requires an API key. Session-limited to prevent runaway costs.

**Escalation targets** (cloud, used only on hard fail):
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 / 4.6, Haiku 4.5
- GPT-5.4 Mini / Nano
- DeepSeek V4 / V4 Pro / V4 Flash

### Context Budget Engine
Never exceeds your model's context window. Automatically summarizes large files to signatures, evicts old messages, and tracks token usage in real time.

### 2-Stage Tool Routing
Halves the schema context overhead. Model picks a category (read/write/search/run/plan) first, then gets only relevant tool schemas. Critical for models with 8-16k context.

### Forgiving Tool Call Parser
Small models produce messy output. SmallCode parses tool calls from JSON, YAML, XML, Hermes format, or plain text. Auto-repairs common mistakes (wrong param names, type mismatches).

### TODO-Driven Planning
Complex tasks get decomposed into atomic steps. The model reads a TODO file each turn to know where it is. Each step is validated (lint/compile) before moving on.

### Patch-First Editing
Search-and-replace as the primary edit primitive. Small models can't reliably reproduce entire files — they truncate, hallucinate, or drift. `patch` is safer and more context-efficient.

### Early-Stop Detection
Detects repetition loops and runaway output. Saves tokens and time when a small model starts spinning.

### Model Profiles
Per-model configuration: context length, tool format (native/hermes/json/xml/text), chat template, strengths/weaknesses. Auto-adapts prompting strategy.

### Working Memory
Persistent scratchpad that survives across turns. Compensates for limited reasoning depth — the model can write notes to itself.
